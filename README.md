**Project Title:** Bitcoin Price Predictor

#### **Feature Selection Methodology**

Feature selection is a crucial step in the machine learning process, as it helps to identify the most relevant features to improve model performance and interpretability. In this project, the features were chosen based on domain knowledge, correlation analysis, and feature importance.

- Open: The opening price of Bitcoin.
- High: The highest price of Bitcoin during the day.
- Low: The lowest price of Bitcoin during the day.
- Log Volume: The logarithm of the trading volume to reduce the effect of outliers.

Using a Random Forest model, the importance of each feature was calculated. The features that had the greatest impact on predicting Bitcoin's closing price were retained. The feature importance analysis highlighted that the High and Low values were the most influential features in predicting Bitcoin's closing price.  

**Models Used:**

- Linear Regression: A simple and interpretable model used to predict Bitcoin's closing price based on the selected features.  

- Random Forest Regressor: A more complex, ensemble method that aggregates predictions from multiple decision trees to provide more accurate results.  

- Neural Network: A deep learning model designed to handle complex patterns in data. It is more computationally expensive but can potentially capture non-linear relationships.

**Hyperparameters Tuned:**

- Number of trees (n_estimators): The total number of trees in the forest.
- Maximum depth (max_depth): The depth of each tree in the forest.
- Minimum samples required to split a node (min_samples_split) and at the leaf node (min_samples_leaf).  

**Training Process:**

1. Data Preprocessing: Features were scaled using StandardScaler to ensure that the models perform well.  

2. Model Training: Both Linear Regression and Random Forest models were trained on the dataset. Hyperparameters were tuned using GridSearchCV for Random Forest.  

3. Model Evaluation: Models were evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R² Score.  

#### **Key Insights from Model Evaluation**

#### After evaluating all the models and based on the plots below, the Linear Regression emerged as the best-performing model, achieving the highest R² score and lowest MSE and MAE. The Deep Learning model performed reasonably well but struggled to capture more complex patterns in the data. The Random Forest provided better results, especially for capturing non-linear relationships in the data

#### **Limitations**

1. Overfitting: The Random Forest model showed signs of overfitting, as it performed well on training data but not as well on testing data.  

2. Data Quality: The model performance could be impacted by the quality and granularity of the data. More granular data (e.g., hourly prices) may improve predictions.  

3. Feature Limitations: While Open, High, Low, and Log Volume were selected as features, additional external data (e.g., market sentiment, economic factors) might improve prediction accuracy.  

#### **Challenges Faced During Implementation**

1. Data Preprocessing: The need to handle missing data, scaling the features, and ensuring the model wasn't biased due to outliers.  

2. Outliers in Volume: There were significant outliers in the Volume attribute but instead of removing them, their logs were calculated. They were not removed because bitcoin fluctuations can have an effect on price prediction.  

3. Model Tuning: Finding the optimal set of hyperparameters for the Random Forest model took considerable time and experimentation.  

4. Overfitting with Random Forest: Random Forest models tend to overfit if hyperparameters like max_depth and n_estimators are not tuned properly.

#### **Predictive Use Case for Bitcoin Price Prediction**

This project could be applied in the real world for predicting Bitcoin's future price, which has several potential use cases in the financial sector:

1. Investment Strategy: Investors could use the model to predict the future price of Bitcoin and make data-driven decisions about when to buy or sell Bitcoin.  

2. Risk Management: Financial institutions and traders can integrate this predictive model into their risk management strategies to minimize losses by forecasting price fluctuations.  

3. Trading Bots: Automated trading systems could use this model to make real-time predictions and execute trades based on predicted future prices.  

4. Cryptocurrency Portfolio Optimization: The model could help investors balance their portfolios by predicting future price trends and adjusting their holdings accordingly.  

#### **Challenges in Real-World Implementation**

- Market Volatility: Bitcoin's market is highly volatile, and external factors (e.g., government regulations, market sentiment) are not included in this model. Therefore, while the model can help with price predictions, it may not be highly accurate in times of extreme market shifts.  

- Data Integration: For better predictions, additional data sources, such as social media sentiment, macroeconomic indicators, or news, could be integrated into the model.

### **Conclusion**

The project demonstrates the use of machine learning techniques to predict Bitcoin's closing price. While the Linear Regression Model was the most accurate model, adding deep learning models or integrating external data could enhance the prediction performance further. Real-world applications, such as investment and trading, could benefit from the insights gained through this model.
